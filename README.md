Project Euler excercises
=====

This will be filled... with effort... and time... and fun!

And with [projecteuler.net](projecteuler.net) problems, of course.

It will be a playground to try **new** languages and practice _old acquaitances_.

The idea is to provide my own solution, then find and implement the best solution Google can provide.

Have fun!
